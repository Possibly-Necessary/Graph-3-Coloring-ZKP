# Zero Knowldege Interactive Proof for Graph 3-Colorability in Go

A (horrible/hideous, messy and incomplete) Go program that attempts to visulize/simulate the concept of Graph 3-Coloring Zero-Knowledge Interactive Proof (G3C ZKIP) discussed in this paper:

Missing parts include: the commitment scheme, the protocol should be done in m^2 rounds where m is the number of edges in the graph G, etc.
